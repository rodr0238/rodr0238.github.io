                Ice Creamery is currently owned and operated by Steffy Antonette Rodrigues. Since 2015, she has expanded the company by introducing private labeling, a wider distribution area for wholesale customers and renovating the shop. Our operation has maintained a long tradition of producing fine quality ice cream. We simply use only the best ingredients and of course 100% Canadian Dairy. Come experience the traditional taste by visiting our shop where you can choose from over 35 different flavours of ice cream.

                        Bonney got his first taste of the dairy business while driving a milk wagon for Mother's Diary in 1965. The owner of the dairy, Bob Arthur eventually asked Bonney to partner with him. Starting his journey from there, Bonney had partnered with many people. In 1980 as his business grew, Bonney built an Ice Cream shop. His aim was to serve the public with the delicious ice cream being made on site. Bonney eventually sold his business to his son in law and later on he sold it to Steffy.
