For my Web Portfolio assignment, I haven't used bootstrap. The coding is done only with HTML and CSS. Problems I faced during the process was with making the pages responsive. I had to do some research and get guidance from my friends to resolve the problem. Tried to complete the final assignment with the best of my abilities and utilizing the knowledge gained from the responsive web lectures.
